# Frontend Browser Audit

This example shows the goal-first path: start from a current frontend objective, then generate a runnable loop packet.

## Story

| Stage | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| **Before** | The user repeatedly asks the agent to verify changed routes, screenshots, console/network state, and i18n fallback after UI work. |
| **SixLoops output** | A Frontend Verification Loop with route discovery, screenshot evidence, state, verifier, and visual/product human gates. |
| **After** | The next agent can run a bounded browser verification cycle, fix only low-risk regressions, and stop when product or visual judgment is needed. |

## Goal

> After frontend route or i18n changes, verify browser screenshots, fix low-risk UI regressions, and stop when product or visual judgment is needed.

## SixLoops Output

SixLoops designs a **Frontend Verification Loop**:

- **Domain**: `frontend`
- **Team mode**: `phased`
- **Starting level**: `isolated-draft`
- **Verifier**: focused browser/static checks chosen during the Decide step
- **Pass evidence**: route list, locale list, screenshot/snapshot summaries, console/network result, i18n summary
- **Human gate**: visual direction, product copy, translation tone, route behavior, auth/data fixtures
- **Exit statuses**: `CONTINUE`, `DONE`, `NEEDS_HUMAN`, `BLOCKED`, `BUDGET_STOPPED`

## After

The next agent should:

1. Read `STATE.json` and project instructions.
2. Identify the smallest route, state, and locale set that proves the change.
3. Choose at most 1-3 visible regressions.
4. Apply only obvious, reversible UI fixes inside scope.
5. Run browser/static verification and capture pass evidence.
6. Stop on product copy, translation tone, visual direction, route behavior, auth/data fixture, or scope decisions.

## Why This Is A Loop

This is not just a checklist because verification often discovers new visible failures. It is not fully autonomous because visual direction and product copy remain human judgment boundaries.
