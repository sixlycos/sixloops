# CI Babysitter

This example shows the full path from repeated CI triage friction to an adoptable loop.

## Story

| Stage | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| **Before** | The user keeps reminding the agent to read failed CI logs before guessing. |
| **SixLoops output** | A CI Babysitter Loop with state, verifier, iteration cap, and push/merge human gate. |
| **After** | The next agent can run the CI triage cycle without repeated prompting, then stop with `DONE`, `BLOCKED`, `NEEDS_HUMAN`, or `BUDGET_STOPPED`. |

## Before

The user keeps repeating:

- "CI is red again."
- "Read the failed job log before guessing."
- "Patch only the evidenced failure."
- "Do not push before local verification."

## SixLoops Output

SixLoops turns that repeated correction into **CI Babysitter Loop**:

- **Mechanism**: `loop, skill`
- **Starting level**: `goal-loop`
- **Can delegate**: `yes`
- **Verifier**: focused project checks / CI status
- **State file**: `.session-to-loop/state/ci-babysitter.json`
- **Human gate**: push, merge
- **Stop condition**: CI green, same failure repeats twice, or push/merge is required

## After

The next agent should:

1. Read the previous CI state.
2. Inspect current CI status, failed logs, and diff.
3. Pick at most 1-3 actionable failures.
4. Patch only direct, low-risk evidence.
5. Run the focused verifier.
6. Update state and return an exit status.

It should not push, merge, keep guessing after repeated failure, or continue when verifier evidence is stale.

## Why This Is A Loop

This is not just a rule because the work needs repeated observe-decide-act-verify cycles with durable state. It is not autonomous deployment because push and merge remain human gates.

## Try This Case

```bash
python skills/session-to-loop/scripts/session_to_loop.py \
  --input evals/fixtures/repeated-ci-failure.jsonl \
  --out-root .session-to-loop/tmp/repeated-ci \
  --approve
```

Then let the host AI write `semantic-candidates.json`, or use the deterministic semantic fixture:

```bash
python skills/session-to-loop/scripts/session_to_loop.py \
  --input evals/fixtures/repeated-ci-failure.jsonl \
  --out-root .session-to-loop/tmp/repeated-ci \
  --scope .session-to-loop/tmp/repeated-ci/private/analysis-scope.json \
  --semantic-candidates evals/semantic-candidates/repeated-ci-failure.json
```
