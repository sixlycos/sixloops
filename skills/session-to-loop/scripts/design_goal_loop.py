Use this as a SixLoops run packet.

## Objective

{design["goal"]}

## Why This Loop

- Why this loop: {design["why_this_loop"]}
- Why not smaller: {design["why_not_smaller"]}
- Why not more autonomous: {design["why_not_more_autonomous"]}
- Fit summary: {design["fit_summary"]}

## Loop Shape

- Domain: `{design["domain"]}`
- Archetype: `{design["loop_archetype"]}`
- Start mode: `{mode}`
- Internal level: `{design["adoption_level"]}`
- Team mode: `{design["team_mode"]}`

## Acceptance Checks

{bullet(contract["success_criteria"])}

## Cycle

{numbered(managed_loop["cycle_steps"])}

## Selection Policy

{bullet(managed_loop["selection_policy"])}

## Verification

{bullet(contract["verifier_commands"])}

Required pass evidence:

{bullet(contract["pass_evidence_required"])}

## Stop Conditions

{bullet(contract["reject_conditions"])}

Also stop after `{managed_loop["max_iterations_per_run"]}` iteration(s), repeated no-progress, or a review boundary.

## Exit Contract

Continue only if:

{bullet(exit_contract["continue_only_if"])}

Return `DONE` when:

{bullet(exit_contract["done_when"])}

Return for review when:

{bullet(exit_contract["needs_human_when"])}

Return `BLOCKED` when:

{bullet(exit_contract["blocked_when"])}

Return `BUDGET_STOPPED` when:

{bullet(exit_contract["budget_stopped_when"])}

## State

- State file: `STATE.json`
- Read state before work.
- Update state before returning any final status.

## Human Gate

{bullet(design["safety"]["requires_approval_for"])}

## Final Status

Return exactly one internal status: `DONE`, `CONTINUE`, `BLOCKED`, `NEEDS_HUMAN`, or `BUDGET_STOPPED`.
In user-facing copy, treat `NEEDS_HUMAN` as return-for-review.

## First Run Retro

Before the next run, update `STATE.json` with whether this loop reduced repeated human correction,
created false positives, required too much human judgment, should be downgraded to a skill/checklist,
or has enough accepted output to keep its current autonomy level.

This folder contains a goal-ready SixLoops design generated from a user objective.

## Why This Loop

- Why this loop: {design["why_this_loop"]}
- Why not smaller: {design["why_not_smaller"]}
- Why not more autonomous: {design["why_not_more_autonomous"]}
- Fit summary: {design["fit_summary"]}

## Start Here

1. Read `GOAL.md`.
2. If team tools are available and team mode is `subagent-team`, use `TEAM.md` to split planner, maker, checker, verifier, and integrator roles.
3. Keep `STATE.json` beside the run and update it before stopping.

## Exit Contract

Continue only if:

{bullet(exits["continue_only_if"])}

Return `DONE` when:

{bullet(exits["done_when"])}

Return for review when:

{bullet(exits["needs_human_when"])}

Return `BLOCKED` when:

{bullet(exits["blocked_when"])}

Return `BUDGET_STOPPED` when:

{bullet(exits["budget_stopped_when"])}

## Learning Check

After each run, record baseline friction, post-run result, saved corrections, false positives,
human acceptance, next adjustment, and demotion recommendation in `STATE.json`.
