# Output Schemas

Use these structures when producing machine-readable artifacts. Markdown reports may use the same fields as headings.

## Loop Classification Fields

- `work_shape`: `process-shaped`, `tool-assisted`, or `goal-driven`.
- `loop_archetype`: short label such as `engineering-maintenance`, `frontend-verification`, `monitoring-research`, `document-batch`, or `delivery-governance`.
- `managed_loop.heartbeat`: `session`, `goal`, `scheduled`, or `event`.
- `managed_loop.recommended_maturity`: `read-only-report`, `goal-loop`, `isolated-draft`, `verified-pr-draft`, `scheduled-readonly`, or `scheduled-draft`.
- `decision_card`: user-facing readiness summary: `can_use_now`, `can_confirm`, `can_delegate`, `missing_before_delegate`, `next_action`, and `confirmation_options`.
- `first_run_packet`: the confirmable starter contract: `recommended_action`, `reply_to_confirm`, `starter_goal_prompt`, `first_run_mode`, `state_file`, `observe`, `decide`, `act`, `verify`, `stop_after`, and `human_gate`.
- `managed_loop.completion_contract`: mandatory for real loops; defines success criteria, verifier commands, evaluator, pass evidence, reject conditions, and no-progress policy.
- `managed_loop.state_schema`: minimal durable state ledger the loop must update before stopping.
- `managed_loop.status_protocol`: allowed statuses: `DONE`, `CONTINUE`, `BLOCKED`, `NEEDS_HUMAN`, and `BUDGET_STOPPED`.
- `economics`: lightweight cost and acceptance estimate: trigger frequency, expected per-run cost, automatic rejection signals, human review load, demotion threshold, and budget caps.

    Goal: Keep CI failures moving toward a verified fix without guessing.
    Success criteria:
    - Failed job logs are inspected before patching.
    - A focused verifier passes, or the blocker is recorded.
    Each round:
    1. Observe CI status, failed logs, and current diff.
    2. Decide the next failure, action, verifier, and escalation path.
    3. Act on at most 1-3 directly evidenced failures.
    4. Verify with the focused project check.
    5. Update .session-to-loop/state/ci-babysitter.json before stopping.
    Stop after 8 iterations, two repeated failure signatures, or a human gate.
