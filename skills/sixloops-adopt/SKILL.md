# SixLoops Adopt

Run the next useful cycle of an existing SixLoops candidate, or shrink/reject
it when the candidate is not ready for automation. A cycle must keep the Change
Map alive: current X, target B, affected surfaces, regression path, rollout
waves, decision packets, and the progression fields that make the next cycle
resume naturally.

## Workflow

1. Read `../sixloops/references/adopt-loop-runbook.md`.
2. Identify the selected candidate and mode from the user's exact reply string.
3. Read the latest card or adoption packet. Create one with
   `../sixloops/scripts/adopt_candidate.py` only when stateful reuse is needed.
4. Run at most one stateful cycle inside the approved mode.
   - `as low-risk edit` authorizes bounded, local, reversible edits with direct
     evidence and a focused verifier. It does not authorize push, merge, deploy,
     production calls, data mutation, credentials, billing, or scope expansion.
   - Refresh the Change Map before choosing work.
   - Pick work by wave order, impact, verifier evidence, and reversibility.
   - Before returning `CONTINUE`, record `next_cursor`,
     `next_expected_evidence`, `next_verifier`, and `human_friction_delta`.
   - `next_cursor` must be one selected non-blocked path. Put alternatives in
     `candidate_next_items`; return review-needed if a human decision blocks
     the selected path.
   - When multiple next actions are plausible, rank and choose the best
     non-blocking shot inside the approved mode before asking the user.
   - Start only the subagent roles needed for the selected shot and stop them
     after evidence or output is integrated into state.
   - If product, architecture, release, UI, data, or migration judgment appears,
     produce a decision packet with options, impact, regression path, and a
     recommendation before returning for review.
5. Update state and return exactly one status: `DONE`, `CONTINUE`,
   review-needed, `BLOCKED`, or `BUDGET_STOPPED`.

## Ask Before High-Impact Finalization

- Install generated project instructions.
- Push, merge, deploy, migrate, delete data, change credentials, alter billing,
  or call production APIs.
- Expand scope beyond the selected candidate and approved mode.
