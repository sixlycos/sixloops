# Adopt Loop Runbook

Use this workflow when the user replies with `start ...`, `continue ...`,
`run ...`, or asks to execute an existing SixLoops candidate.

## Goal

Run the next useful cycle inside the approved mode, update the Change Map,
progression fields, and state, and return one clear status: `DONE`,
`CONTINUE`, review-needed, `BLOCKED`, or `BUDGET_STOPPED`.

## Workflow

1. Identify the selected candidate and mode.
   - Use the exact reply string when present.
   - Prefer the most capable mode that is approved, reversible, and verifiable.
   - If the user selects `as low-risk edit`, treat local, bounded, reversible
     edits with direct evidence as approved for this cycle. Still ask before
     push, merge, deploy, production calls, data mutation, credentials, billing,
     dependency changes, schema changes, or scope expansion.
   - Do not infer approval for merge, deploy, production, credentials, data,
     payment, deletion, or schema changes.

2. Read the latest card or adoption packet.
   - Candidate card: `cards/<candidate-id>.md`.
   - Agent handoff: `claude-loops/<candidate-id>.md`.
   - Adoption packet: `GOAL.md`, `STATE.json`, `HANDOFF.md`, and optional
     `AGENTS-snippet.md`.

3. Create an adoption packet when stateful reuse is needed and none exists:

   ```bash
   python skills/sixloops/scripts/adopt_candidate.py \
     --candidates <candidates.json> \
     --candidate-id <candidate-id> \
     --mode "<mode>" \
     --out-dir <adoption-dir>
   ```

4. Run one bounded cycle.
   - Read state first.
   - Refresh the Change Map: current X, target B, user perception, affected
     surfaces, regression path, rollout waves, and open decisions.
   - Select at most 1-3 active items.
   - Prefer the next wave that improves the Change Map, lowers blast radius, or
     produces verifier evidence.
   - Act only inside the approved mode.
   - When a product, architecture, release, data, UI, or migration judgment is
     needed, write a decision packet with options, impact, regression path, and
     recommendation before returning for review.
   - Verify with the listed verifier.
   - Before returning `CONTINUE`, record the exact `next_cursor`,
     `next_expected_evidence`, `next_verifier`, and `human_friction_delta`.
   - `next_cursor` must be one selected, non-blocked path. Put other plausible
     next steps in `candidate_next_items`. If a human decision blocks the
     selected path, return review-needed instead of `CONTINUE`.
   - When multiple next actions are plausible, rank them by value, verifier,
     reversibility, risk, and approved mode; choose the best non-blocking shot
     before asking the user.
   - Start only the subagent roles needed for that shot, and stop them after
     their evidence or output is integrated into state.
   - Update state before stopping.

5. Return status.
   - `DONE`: acceptance checks passed with evidence.
   - `CONTINUE`: another cycle can improve the Change Map, verified certainty,
     or regression evidence; `next_cursor`, `next_expected_evidence`, and
     `next_verifier` are concrete; and budget remains.
   - review-needed: human judgment or explicit approval is required after the
     decision packet or approval evidence is ready.
   - `BLOCKED`: reliable progress is not possible with current evidence, or the
     next cursor / expected evidence / verifier is vague.
   - `BUDGET_STOPPED`: item, iteration, time, token, or cost cap was reached.

## Ask Before High-Impact Finalization

- Install `AGENTS-snippet.md` into project instructions.
- Push, merge, deploy, migrate, delete data, change credentials, alter billing,
  or call production APIs.
- Expand scope beyond the selected candidate and approved mode.
