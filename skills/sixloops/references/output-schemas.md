# Output Schemas

Use these structures when producing machine-readable artifacts. Markdown reports may use the same fields as headings.

## Loop Classification Fields

- `work_shape`: `process-shaped`, `tool-assisted`, or `goal-driven`.
- `loop_archetype`: short label such as `engineering-maintenance`, `frontend-verification`, `monitoring-research`, `document-batch`, or `delivery-governance`.
- `team_mode`: `none`, `phased`, or `subagent-team`.
- `managed_loop.heartbeat`: `session`, `goal`, `scheduled`, or `event`.
- `managed_loop.recommended_maturity`: `read-only`, `goal-loop`, `isolated-draft`, `verified-pr-draft`, `scheduled-readonly`, or `scheduled-draft`.
- `decision_card`: user-facing readiness summary: `can_use_now`, `can_confirm`, `can_delegate`, `missing_before_delegate`, `next_action`, and `confirmation_options`.
- User-facing mode names map onto internal maturity values through `scripts/sixloops/core/mode_policy.py`: `read-only` -> `read-only`, `low-risk edit` -> `goal-loop`, `worktree draft` -> `isolated-draft`, `PR draft` -> `verified-pr-draft`, `scheduled read-only` -> `scheduled-readonly`, and `scheduled draft` -> `scheduled-draft`.
- `schemas/semantic-candidates.schema.json`: host AI output contract. Scripts consume this schema after packet selection; they do not use regex fallback as the primary loop-value judge.
- `raw_ai_claims`: private copy of the host AI candidate before deterministic guardrails normalize render fields.
- `normalized_render_fields`: fields defaulted only so draft artifacts can render; defaults do not make a loop delegable.
- `delegation_gate`: raw-AI-claims-only eligibility check for `can_delegate=yes`.
- `first_run_packet`: the confirmable starter contract: `recommended_action`, `reply_to_confirm`, `starter_goal_prompt`, `first_run_mode`, `state_file`, `observe`, `decide`, `act`, `verify`, `stop_after`, and `human_gate`.
- `managed_loop.completion_contract`: mandatory for real loops; defines success criteria, verifier commands, evaluator, pass evidence, reject conditions, and no-progress policy.
- `managed_loop.loop_exit_contract`: mandatory for goal-ready loops; defines when to continue, return done, ask a human, block, or stop by budget.
- `schemas/loop-exit-contract.schema.json`: machine-readable shape for the mandatory exit contract.
- `managed_loop.state_schema`: minimal durable state ledger the loop must update before stopping.
- `managed_loop.status_protocol`: allowed statuses: `DONE`, `CONTINUE`, `BLOCKED`, `NEEDS_HUMAN`, and `BUDGET_STOPPED`.
- `economics`: lightweight cost and acceptance estimate: trigger frequency, expected per-run cost, automatic rejection signals, human review load, demotion threshold, and budget caps.

    Objective: Keep CI failures moving toward a verified fix without guessing.
    Acceptance checks:
    - Failed job logs are inspected before patching.
    - A focused verifier passes, or the blocker is recorded.
    First cycle:
    1. Observe CI status, failed logs, and current diff.
    2. Decide the next failure, action, verifier, and escalation path.
    3. Act on at most 1-3 directly evidenced failures.
    4. Verify with the focused project check.
    5. Update .sixloops/state/ci-babysitter.json before stopping.
    Stop after 8 iterations, two repeated failure signatures, or a human gate.
