# Goal Loop Designer

Use this reference when the user gives a goal and wants SixLoops to design a loop directly, even when no past session logs are available.

## When To Use

Use the demand-driven goal designer when the user says things like:

- "Design a loop for this project."
- "I want an agent to keep working toward this goal."
- "Create a loop engineering workflow for frontend/backend/review/delivery."
- "Let the user放手不管 after confirmation."
- "Use a subagent team if appropriate."

This mode is different from transcript mining. It starts from the user's current objective, produces a Change Map, then produces a goal-ready loop design that can later be improved with historical evidence.

## Design Standard

Every goal loop must include:

- A concrete objective.
- A Change Map:
  - current X,
  - target B,
  - how the user or operator will perceive X becoming B,
  - affected product and technical surfaces,
  - regression, recovery, or compatibility checks,
  - rollout waves,
  - decision packet triggers for judgment that cannot be delegated.
- A domain: `frontend`, `backend`, `fullstack`, `architecture`, `review`, `delivery`, `maintenance`, or `general`.
- A trigger or cadence.
- Discovery sources.
- Observe-decide-act-verify cycle steps.
- Selection policy for at most 1-3 high-value items.
- Verifier commands or checks.
- Success criteria and pass evidence.
- Stop conditions and no-progress policy.
- Loop exit contract with `CONTINUE`, `DONE`, review-needed, `BLOCKED`, and `BUDGET_STOPPED` boundaries. Internal JSON may still use `NEEDS_HUMAN`. `NEEDS_HUMAN` should mean that a decision packet or approval boundary is ready, not that the agent merely noticed uncertainty.
- Progression contract: what each cycle must record, where the next cycle resumes, what new evidence the next cycle expects, which verifier can reject it, and how much repeated human correction was removed or introduced.
- Autonomy contract: how the model chooses the next bounded shot from candidate next items, controls planner/maker/checker/verifier role start-stop, and avoids asking the user for ordinary engineering prioritization.
- State file and resume policy.
- Run protocol and verifier protocol.
- Review boundary and the mode required for higher-impact actions.
- Optional subagent team roles.
- For product-building goals, place work in the right feedback cadence only
  when it changes execution authority, verifier choice, or return point:
  agentic coding loop in minutes, developer feedback loop in tens of minutes to
  hours, and external feedback loop in hours to weeks. Do not treat slower
  product, user, or market judgment as an inner-loop verifier.

If the goal is vague, design a read-only or planning loop first. If the user grants edit, worktree, or PR-draft authority, make the first cycle runnable in that mode.

Before designing a managed loop, run the same fit test used for transcript-derived candidates:

- The goal is likely to recur or continue across multiple cycles, and each cycle can leave a concrete next cursor instead of restarting the same prompt.
- Objective checks can reject bad output.
- The agent can inspect or run the changed system.
- The loop has explicit item, iteration, time, token, or cost caps.
- High-impact actions require the matching user-approved mode or explicit approval before merge, deploy, dependency, credential, schema, data, payment, or production changes.
- `CONTINUE` is justified only when the next cursor, expected evidence, and next verifier are concrete.
- Review-needed is justified only after the model has selected or exhausted useful non-blocking actions inside the approved mode.

If the fit test fails, return a Change Map, read-only loop, skill, checklist, decision packet, approval gate, or rejection instead of a delegated loop.

## Change Map Standard

The first useful output for a direct goal is the transformation picture. The user should be able to answer:

- What is X today?
- What is B after the product or technical change?
- What product or technical idea turns X into B?
- What is the blast radius?
- How will the loop verify or regress it?
- What sequence of research, code mining, product function change, implementation, and verification waves will run?

For the user-group/resource-group example, the Change Map should make the picture concrete:

- X: user identity group, resource/channel group, and subscription upgrade group reuse one group namespace.
- B: product and code distinguish identity groups from resource routing groups while preserving existing data compatibility.
- User perception: operators see separate concepts and safer configuration rather than one overloaded "group" table.
- Affected surfaces: models, service helpers, controllers, rename behavior, settings UI, subscription validation, tests, and migration/release notes.
- Regression: focused group service tests, subscription tests, rename tests, admin UI smoke, compatibility checks, and migration dry run when applicable.
- Waves: evidence map, vocabulary boundary, compatible code slice, UI/config split, subscription decision packet, migration/release plan.

## Subagent Team Policy

When the host runtime exposes subagent or multi-agent tools, use a team only when it improves the loop:

- Use separate planner/checker/verifier roles for cross-surface, risky, or verification-heavy work.
- Keep maker roles inside explicit edit scope.
- Prefer independent reviewer/verifier agents after implementation when possible.
- Do not spawn a team for a tiny one-step task.
- If subagent tools are unavailable, execute the same roles sequentially in the current agent and keep the `TEAM.md` prompts as handoff prompts.

When the user explicitly asks to start, run, delegate, or use a subagent team:

- Read `TEAM.md`.
- Spawn only the roles needed for the current cycle.
- Prefer planner, checker/reviewer, verifier, and integrator as separate agents when independence matters.
- Spawn maker roles only when edit scope is explicit and bounded.
- Give each subagent one role prompt, the goal, allowed scope, expected output, and a reminder not to expand scope.
- While subagents run, continue non-overlapping work in the main thread.
- Integrate role outputs into `STATE.json` and return one status code: `DONE`, `CONTINUE`, `BLOCKED`, `NEEDS_HUMAN`, or `BUDGET_STOPPED` (in user-facing copy, `NEEDS_HUMAN` is called review-needed).

Default team roles:

- Planner: clarify objective, affected surfaces, 1-3 items, verifier path, and review boundaries.
- Maker: implement only approved, reversible changes.
- Checker or reviewer: inspect diff, likely regressions, missing tests, and risky assumptions.
- Verifier: run or specify the smallest check that can reject bad output.
- Integrator: merge role outputs, update state, and return final status.

## Script

First write the host-model-authored semantic handoff. The script should receive
the model's domain, team mode, level, Change Map, and rationale instead of
inferring them from free text:

```json
{
  "domain": "architecture",
  "team_mode": "subagent-team",
  "level": "isolated-draft",
  "change_map": {
    "current_x": "...",
    "target_b": "...",
    "user_perception": "...",
    "transformation_thesis": "...",
    "affected_surfaces": ["..."],
    "regression_plan": ["..."],
    "rollback_or_compatibility": ["..."],
    "research_questions": ["..."],
    "waves": ["..."],
    "decision_packet_required_when": ["..."]
  },
  "rationale": {
    "why_this_loop": "...",
    "why_not_smaller": "...",
    "why_not_more_autonomous": "...",
    "fit_summary": "..."
  }
}
```

Then run:

```bash
python skills/sixloops/scripts/design_goal_loop.py \
  --goal "<user goal>" \
  --model-design-file <model-authored.json> \
  --out-dir .sixloops/goal-design
```

The script writes:

- `GOAL.md`
- `STATE.json`
- `RUN.md`
- `VERIFY.md`
- `TEAM.md`
- `HANDOFF.md`
- `AGENTS-snippet.md`
- `HOST-START.md`
- `CODEX-GOAL.md`
- `CLAUDE-LOOP.md`
- `host-start-packet.json`
- `goal-loop-design.json`
- `manifest.json`

Use explicit `--domain`, `--team-mode`, and `--level` only when the host model
has already chosen those values. `auto` is fallback scaffolding for offline
fixtures or host-model-unavailable mode, not a substitute for model judgment.

Use `subagent-team` only when team decomposition is useful. Use `phased` when
the same agent should run the roles sequentially.

Before presenting the result, check `loop-exit-contract.md`. The generated loop must explain when another cycle will add verified certainty and when it must return to the human. It must also show the progression contract: the next cursor, next expected evidence, next verifier, and human friction delta that make the next cycle natural. It must show the autonomy contract: model-led next-shot selection, self-iteration, subagent start-stop, and human return boundaries. User-facing presentation should lead with the `GOAL.md` Change Map, then the execution contract and host-native start surface. `HOST-START.md` must identify local Codex and Claude Code availability, give exact copy commands for `CODEX-GOAL.md` and `CLAUDE-LOOP.md`, and explain how to paste them into Codex `/goal` or Claude Code `/loop`; `RUN.md`, `VERIFY.md`, and `STATE.json` are agent-facing harness files.

Do not turn SixLoops into a competing loop runtime. SixLoops emits the policy,
state, verifier, rollback, autonomy, and exit contract; Codex or Claude Code
executes the loop through its own runtime.

## Output First

Lead with the Change Map, then the Start Plan:

1. Current X.
2. Target B.
3. User perception.
4. Affected surfaces.
5. Regression or compatibility path.
6. Rollout waves.
7. First cycle.
8. Team shape if any.
9. Verifier.
10. Stop condition.
11. Review boundary and selected mode.
12. Progression rhythm and required state delta.
13. Autonomy policy for model decision and role control.
14. Host start packet paths and copy commands when artifacts are generated.
15. Generated artifact paths.

Put evidence limitations after the loop design. In demand-driven mode, the source is the user's current goal, not historical transcript evidence.
