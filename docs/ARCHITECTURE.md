# SixLoops Architecture

This repository has two boundaries:

- The **publishable skill package** under `skills/sixloops/`.
- The **repository support layer** around it, which contains docs, examples,
  evals, packaging scripts, and local run output.

Keep `skills/sixloops/` stable. Codex, Claude Code, install scripts,
release packaging, examples, and README commands all rely on that path.

## Publishable Skill Boundary

Everything required at runtime should live under `skills/sixloops/`.
The skill package should not depend on `evals/`, `examples/`, root-level
`scripts/`, or generated `.sixloops/` contents.

Inside the skill package:

- `SKILL.md` is the entrypoint and host-agent contract.
- `references/` stores long-lived reasoning policy, routing rules, safety
  boundaries, scoring rubrics, and semantic prompts.
- `schemas/` stores machine-readable contracts used by scripts and host review.
- `assets/templates/` stores reusable rendered output shells.
- `scripts/*.py` contains stable command wrappers for documented invocations.
- `scripts/sixloops/core/` contains shared contracts, mode policy, and transcript
  adapters.
- `scripts/sixloops/pipeline/` contains the transcript analysis stages.
- `scripts/sixloops/goals/` contains direct goal-loop design and candidate
  adoption packet generation.
- `agents/` contains integration metadata for host runtimes.

Python implementation modules in `skills/sixloops/scripts/sixloops/`
should import only the standard library and sibling `sixloops` modules unless
there is a deliberate, documented reason to cross the package boundary.

## Execution Flows

### Transcript Analysis

```text
sixloops.py
  -> discover_claude_sessions.py
  -> prepare_analysis_scope.py
  -> redact_transcripts.py
  -> build_analysis_packets.py
  -> host AI semantic review
  -> apply_guardrails.py
  -> render_artifacts.py
```

Main outputs:

- Private intermediates: `.sixloops/private/`
- Shareable rendered artifacts: `.sixloops/*/public/`
- Continue metadata: `.sixloops/*/private/analysis-run.json`

### Direct Goal Design

```text
design_goal_loop.py
  -> GOAL.md
  -> TEAM.md
  -> STATE.json
  -> HANDOFF.md
  -> AGENTS-snippet.md
  -> goal-loop-design.json
```

### Candidate Adoption

```text
adopt_candidate.py
  -> stateful run packet
  -> GOAL.md / STATE.json / HANDOFF.md / AGENTS-snippet.md
```

## Dependency Direction

Allowed dependency direction:

```text
README/docs
scripts/install + scripts/package
evals
examples
        -> skills/sixloops

skills/sixloops -> standard library + sibling script modules
```

Avoid reverse dependencies from the skill package into repo support layers.
That keeps the installed skill portable after it is copied to
`~/.agents/skills/sixloops`, `~/.claude/skills/sixloops`, or a
project skill directory.

## Change Placement

Use this table when adding or moving project material.

| Change type | Put it in |
| --- | --- |
| Host-agent behavior, workflow contract, start modes | `skills/sixloops/SKILL.md` |
| Durable policy, routing, safety model, semantic prompt, rubric | `skills/sixloops/references/` |
| JSON structure consumed by scripts or host review | `skills/sixloops/schemas/` |
| Stable documented command path | `skills/sixloops/scripts/*.py` wrapper |
| Shared contracts, modes, transcript adapters | `skills/sixloops/scripts/sixloops/core/` |
| Transcript discovery, redaction, packets, guardrails, rendering | `skills/sixloops/scripts/sixloops/pipeline/` |
| Direct goal design or candidate adoption packets | `skills/sixloops/scripts/sixloops/goals/` |
| Rendered markdown shells or localized artifact text | `skills/sixloops/assets/templates/` |
| Regression fixture inputs or expected semantic candidates | `evals/` |
| Checked-in demo output for users to inspect | `examples/` |
| Install, packaging, and release helper commands | `scripts/` |
| README screenshots or diagrams | `assets/readme/` |
| Raw logs, private packets, temp runs, generated eval output | `.sixloops/` |
| Release zips or other build products | `dist/` |

## Verification Map

Use the smallest relevant check for the layer changed:

```bash
python C:/Users/Administrator/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py skills/sixloops
python evals/run_evals.py --keep-going
python evals/run_goal_design_evals.py --keep-going
python scripts/package_skill.py
```

For docs-only edits, review links and command examples. For script or schema
edits, run the matching eval runner before release.
