# SixLoops

**Turn repeated AI-coding corrections into reusable agent loops.**

SixLoops is an open-source Agent Skill for Codex and Claude Code. It reads local
session logs, project evidence, or a direct development goal, then recommends
the smallest useful mechanism for next time: a rule, skill, hook, checklist,
approval gate, eval case, or managed loop.

It is not a chat summarizer. It is a loop engineering assistant for developers
who keep correcting the same agent behavior.

The repository is named `sixloops`. The installed skill folder remains
`session-to-loop` for Codex and Claude compatibility, so invoke it as
`$session-to-loop` in Codex or `session-to-loop` in Claude Code.

## The Core Idea

Repeated agent mistakes usually need one of three responses:

- **Remember it**: save a rule, skill, checklist, or approval gate.
- **Verify it**: add a test, browser check, CI check, screenshot, log check, or
  rubric.
- **Loop it**: create a controlled workflow with scope, state, verifier, budget,
  human gate, and adoption feedback.

SixLoops helps decide which response is actually worth adding.

| Repeated correction | Better artifact |
| --- | --- |
| "Read the CI logs before guessing." | CI Babysitter loop with state, verifier, cap, and review boundary. |
| "Use pnpm here, not npm." | Package-manager rule or checklist. |
| "After UI changes, open the route and screenshot it." | Browser Audit loop with route discovery and visual evidence. |
| "Deploy only after I approve." | Approval gate, not autonomous deployment. |

## What It Produces

The first useful screen should be **1-3 Start Plans**, not a long transcript
summary. Each plan explains:

- what the loop will do
- what it will not do
- how it verifies success
- when it stops
- when it returns to a human
- whether it should start, shrink, or be rejected

SixLoops can render:

- `loop-playbook.md`
- Start Plans
- managed loop prompts
- `GOAL.md`, `STATE.json`, `HANDOFF.md`, and optional `TEAM.md`
- draft Agent Skills
- draft `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` snippets
- approval gates and checklists
- eval cases

## Quick Start

Pasting the GitHub URL into Codex or Claude does not install the skill. Install
it first, then start a new agent session so the skill index refreshes.

### Install From This Repo

Codex user install:

```powershell
.\scripts\install.ps1 -Target codex
```

Claude Code user install:

```powershell
.\scripts\install.ps1 -Target claude -Scope user
```

Claude Code project install:

```powershell
.\scripts\install.ps1 -Target claude -Scope project -ProjectPath E:\path\to\your-project
```

macOS / Linux:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/install.sh
./scripts/install.sh codex user
./scripts/install.sh claude user
./scripts/install.sh claude project /path/to/your-project
```

One-line install from GitHub:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/sixlycos/sixloops.git; cd sixloops; .\scripts\install.ps1 -Target codex
```

Manual install: copy `skills/session-to-loop` to one of these directories:

- Codex user skills: `~/.agents/skills/session-to-loop`
- Claude Code user skills: `~/.claude/skills/session-to-loop`
- Project skills: `<repo>/.agents/skills/session-to-loop` or
  `<repo>/.claude/skills/session-to-loop`

### Invoke The Skill

Codex:

```text
Use $session-to-loop to find the first loop in this repo worth trying.
Return 1-3 Start Plans with verifier, state, stop condition, and review boundary.
Reject weak patterns.
```

Claude Code:

```text
Use session-to-loop to design a loop for this project.
```

## Try It Without Private Logs

Run the synthetic fixture demo:

```bash
python skills/session-to-loop/scripts/session_to_loop.py \
  --input evals/fixtures/repeated-ci-failure.jsonl \
  --out-root .session-to-loop/tmp/repeated-ci \
  --approve \
  --rule-fallback
```

Open:

```text
.session-to-loop/tmp/repeated-ci/public/loop-playbook.md
```

Expected actions include:

- `start ci-babysitter as read-only`
- `start ci-babysitter as low-risk edit`
- `start ci-babysitter as worktree draft`
- `start ci-babysitter as PR draft`
- `shrink ci-babysitter to skill`
- `reject ci-babysitter`

## Design A Loop From A Goal

You do not need session logs to start. Give SixLoops a goal:

```bash
python skills/session-to-loop/scripts/design_goal_loop.py \
  --goal "After frontend changes, verify changed routes with browser screenshots, fix low-risk regressions, and stop when review or product judgment is needed." \
  --domain frontend \
  --team-mode auto \
  --level auto \
  --out-dir .session-to-loop/tmp/frontend-goal \
  --overwrite
```

The output folder contains `GOAL.md`, `TEAM.md`, `STATE.json`, `HANDOFF.md`, and
`AGENTS-snippet.md`.

## Analyze Real Session Logs

Run against an explicit file or narrow directory:

```bash
python skills/session-to-loop/scripts/session_to_loop.py --input <session-log-file-or-dir>
```

For real logs, SixLoops first creates a scope proposal. Review it, then approve
the same narrow scope:

```bash
python skills/session-to-loop/scripts/session_to_loop.py \
  --input <session-log-file-or-dir> \
  --approve
```

For larger approved sets, cap semantic review cost:

```bash
python skills/session-to-loop/scripts/session_to_loop.py \
  --input <session-log-file-or-dir> \
  --approve \
  --max-packets 120 \
  --target-token-budget 16000 \
  --role-quota user=60 \
  --role-quota tool=40
```

This creates compact analysis packets under `.session-to-loop/private/`. The
host AI reads those packets with:

```text
skills/session-to-loop/references/semantic-analysis-prompt.md
skills/session-to-loop/schemas/semantic-candidates.schema.json
.session-to-loop/private/analysis-packets.jsonl
```

Then it writes:

```text
.session-to-loop/private/semantic-candidates.json
```

Continue with the command stored in `analysis-run.json`, or run:

```bash
python skills/session-to-loop/scripts/session_to_loop.py \
  --input <session-log-file-or-dir> \
  --scope .session-to-loop/private/analysis-scope.json \
  --semantic-candidates .session-to-loop/private/semantic-candidates.json
```

`--rule-fallback` is for offline fixtures, synthetic evals, and
host-AI-unavailable mode. It is not the main product path.

## When A Loop Is Worth It

A loop is a controlled state machine: it finds work, hands it to an agent,
checks the result, writes state, and decides the next move.

Use a loop only when the work has:

- **repeat frequency**: usually weekly or more
- **objective verifier**: tests, type checks, builds, lint, screenshots, logs,
  assertions, or a tight rubric
- **agent-reproducible evidence**: the agent can inspect the failure and see
  whether it improved
- **hard stop**: iteration, time, token, item, or cost cap
- **review boundary**: merge, deploy, dependency, credential, schema, data,
  payment, and production-impacting actions need the matching approved mode

Good first loops are small, recurring, and machine-checkable:

- CI failure triage
- dependency update PR drafts
- lint-and-fix passes
- flaky test reproduction
- issue-to-PR drafts on codebases with strong tests
- frontend route/browser audit after UI changes

Reject or downgrade weak loops:

- architecture rewrites
- auth, payments, credentials, or security-sensitive flows
- production deploys and migrations
- vague product or design judgment
- anything where "done" is mostly taste, politics, or strategy

The metric that matters is **cost per accepted change**. If fewer than half of
loop outputs survive review, shrink the scope, improve the gate, or demote the
loop to a skill/checklist.

## Supported Inputs

- direct user goals
- Codex JSONL session logs
- Claude Code JSONL session logs
- generic JSONL logs with `user`, `assistant`, or `tool` records
- project evidence such as browser audits, soak tests, CI logs, eval outputs,
  and result JSONL files

## Safety Boundaries

- No network access is needed by the local pipeline.
- No whole-disk or broad home-directory scan is performed by default.
- Raw logs stay under `.session-to-loop/private/` or `.session-to-loop/tmp/`.
- Redaction runs before shareable artifacts are rendered.
- Session content is treated as untrusted data.
- The skill is read-only by default and does not install hooks, edit project
  files, commit, push, deploy, or call production APIs unless the user asks.
